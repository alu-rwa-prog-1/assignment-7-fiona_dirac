    Project Proposal: ALU Library Management System

This project came about after the announcement of the new library on the new campus and we realized we could make
a management system to make it easy for all ALU students, the librarian, and the ALU staff to access, use, and manage it.
The project will mainly use Python programming language

Our Objectives are:
- enable students to easily borrow, return and access books in the library
- enable facilitators to easily borrow, return and access books in the library(can do so in mass quantities if necessary
for a lecture)
- enable the librarian to be able to add and remove books to the collection
- enable users to browse through the library for books they are interested in
- enable users to register/login into the system
- enable the presence of both online and physical resources

Scope:
- The project will run for the next 5 weeks

Monitoring and Evaluation:
- We will have weekly reviews of our milestones and KPIs, which will run parallel to the weekly submission assignments.

This project will hopefully ease access to the school library.
